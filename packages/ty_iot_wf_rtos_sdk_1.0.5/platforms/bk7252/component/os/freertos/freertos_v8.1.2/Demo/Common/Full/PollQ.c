/**
 * This is a very simple queue test.  See the BlockQ. c documentation for a more 
 * comprehensive version.
 *
 * Creates two tasks that communicate over a single queue.  One task acts as a 
 * producer, the other a consumer.  
 *
 * The producer loops for three iteration, posting an incrementing number onto the 
 * queue each cycle.  It then delays for a fixed period before doing exactly the 
 * same again.
 *
 * The consumer loops emptying the queue.  Each item removed from the queue is 
 * checked to ensure it contains the expected value.  When the queue is empty it 
 * blocks for a fixed period, then does the same again.
 *
 * All queue access is performed without blocking.  The consumer completely empties 
 * the queue each time it runs so the producer should never find the queue full.  
 *
 * An error is flagged if the consumer obtains an unexpected value or the producer 
 * find the queue is full.
